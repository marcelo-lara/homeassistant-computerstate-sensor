# Computer State Sensor for HA

## Background

I want to turn off my office lights when my computer is locked.

This is based on a script from [this thread from vlycop](https://community.home-assistant.io/t/linux-gnome-retreive-the-lock-or-unlock-state-of-your-linux-computer/181489)


## Install





## Sensor reference

### Lock status

TODO:
Update status when Gnome screensaver locks/unlocks the computer

### Docked status

TODO:
Update status when computer is connected to the dock station. (battery is charging state?)

### Push Slack notifications (?)

TODO:

Set an input based on the slack status: (dot on the icon status replicated in HA?)
